Translating users' natural language queries (NL) into SQL queries can significantly reduce barriers to accessing relational databases and support various commercial applications. The performance of Text-to-SQL has been greatly improved with the emergence of language models (LMs). In this context, it is crucial to assess our current position, determine the Text-to-SQL solutions that should be adopted for specific scenarios by practitioners, and identify the research topics that researchers should explore next.
